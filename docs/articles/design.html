<h1 id="libplanet-design">Libplanet design</h1>

<p>Libplanet is a sort of network/storage library for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer">peer-to-peer</a>
distributed multiplayer games.  From a perspective of this library's user,
it can be like a client library of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service">PaaS</a> for games, except that autonomous
nodes run by gamers communicate with each other without any authority of
the centralized server.</p>
<p>Under the hood, because we should ignore malicious nodes in the network so that
nodes gamers run can be autonomous, it is based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature">digital signature</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance">BFT</a> consensus, and data replication, or instead, we can call it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain">blockchain</a>.</p>
<p>Implementing blockchain and BFT consensus for peer-to-peer distributed
multiplayer games is highly complicated, requires a lot of code to
be written, and is fitful and tedious to test.  For the future of decentralized
online games to come, rather than every single game making such redundant
effort, it will be a cost-efficient way to achieve a high level of product
quality that we make an open source library for common things together.</p>
<h2 id="platform-and-packaging">Platform and packaging</h2>
<p>Libplanet is a .NET library at present in order to be used along with <a href="https://unity3d.com/">Unity</a>,
that a lot of small and big teams creating video games use.  (We have a
long-running roadmap to support other platforms, though.)</p>
<p>However, Libplanet is not only a Unity plugin distributed through
the <a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/">Unity Asset Store</a>, but also a standard .NET library distributed through
<a href="https://www.nuget.org/">NuGet</a>.  Because, as <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Mining">block mining</a> is indispensable for running
the decentralized public network, besides nodes gamers run (i.e., game apps),
it needs to be possible to make non-game headless nodes to mine (i.e., miners)
as well.  A peer-to-peer distributed multiplayer game based on Libplanet can be
packaged as both forms at a time: a game app drawing beautiful graphics
through the Unity engine for gamers' machines (e.g., Android, iOS, macOS,
Windows), and a mining <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daemon_(computing)">daemon</a> runnable on miners' machines
(e.g., Linux).</p>
<p>For the maximum compatibility and portability, we currently target
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard">.NET Standard</a> 2.0.</p>
<h2 id="transactions-and-actions">Transactions and actions</h2>
<p>Every action happened in a game built on Libplanet should be recorded in
the blockchain.  Although trivial things like chatting between players could be
an exception as these do not affect rules or incentives of a game, the whole
things, e.g., character's moving, battle, progression (i.e., exp), item drops,
reinforcements, breakages, trades, that are non-trivial and affect game states
should be recorded to the append-only log.  Each log has its own digital
signature to prove that the corresponding gamer did it.</p>
<p>We call the unit of such pair of log and its signature a
<a class="xref" href="../api/Libplanet.Tx.Transaction-1.html">Transaction&lt;T&gt;</a>, and it consists of multiple
<a class="xref" href="../api/Libplanet.Tx.Transaction-1.html#Libplanet_Tx_Transaction_1_Actions">Actions</a>.  How transactions and actions grouped is
left to a game engineer's discretion.  For example, if there are four actions
like <em>A</em> to <em>D</em>, these can be grouped altogether (e.g., <em>{A, B, C, D}</em>),
or be into two or three groups (e.g., <em>{A} &amp; {B, C, D}</em>), or rather have
their sole group (e.g., <em>{A} &amp; {B} &amp; {C} &amp; {D}</em>).</p>
<p>The primary purpose of separating transactions and actions is to have
the flexible granularity of synchronization between nodes in the network.
An actor can put one transaction they signed into a block at most.
A transaction included in a block is confirmed by other nodes in the network
when the block is mined.  It is also known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_(computer_science)">consensus</a>
in distributed systems.</p>
<p>It takes 5 to 20 seconds to mine a block.  It means that if we group four
actions <em>A</em> to <em>D</em> into four distinct transactions like <em>{A} &amp; {B} &amp; {C} &amp; {D}</em>
it must take 20 seconds at fastest to 80 seconds at latest until four actions
are all confirmed in the network.  On the other hand, if we group the whole
actions into a single transaction like <em>{A, B, C, D}</em> it takes only 5 seconds
at best to 20 seconds even at worst.</p>
<p>Does it imply the best practice is to put as many actions as possible into
as few transactions as possible?  It is not that simple.</p>
<p>Putting many actions into few transactions decreases the immediacy of
each action.  To other nodes (gamers), it looks like there is no change at
all for a time, and then suddenly many things happen at a time.
Grouping actions into transactions it balancing between throughput and latency,
so different strategies should be chosen for the goal that a game aims to.</p>
<p>There is another reason to group actions into transactions besides latency
control.  It is, so actions made by different players interact with each other.
For example, in a card game, right after a player ends their turn, they need to
wait until the opponent ends their turn.  Even if it is desirable to increase
throughput, it is nonsense to group two turns of actions into one transaction.
A player's next turn can start only after the opponent's current turn is
determined.  From this perspective, a transaction represents a unit of
dependency, rather than a unit of throughput.</p>
<p>At a code level, another difference between <a class="xref" href="../api/Libplanet.Tx.Transaction-1.html">Transaction&lt;T&gt;</a> and
<a class="xref" href="../api/Libplanet.Action.IAction.html">IAction</a> is that <a class="xref" href="../api/Libplanet.Tx.Transaction-1.html">Transaction&lt;T&gt;</a> is not
extensible whereas <a class="xref" href="../api/Libplanet.Action.IAction.html">IAction</a> is.  By design, an extension
point for game engineers is <a class="xref" href="../api/Libplanet.Action.IAction.html">IAction</a>.  To sum up,
<a class="xref" href="../api/Libplanet.Tx.Transaction-1.html">Transaction&lt;T&gt;</a> purposes to control synchronization on
the network and <a class="xref" href="../api/Libplanet.Action.IAction.html">IAction</a> purposes to implement the actual
game logic.</p>
<h2 id="accounts-and-addresses">Accounts and addresses</h2>
<p>Libplanet creates digital signatures to find what player node made each
transaction, without any authority of the centralized server.
In the similar fashion to <a href="https://bitcoin.org/">Bitcoin</a> and <a href="https://www.ethereum.org/">Ethereum</a>, a transaction is signed
with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm">ECDSA</a>, and a pair of each player's sole <a class="xref" href="../api/Libplanet.Crypto.PrivateKey.html">PrivateKey</a>
and <a class="xref" href="../api/Libplanet.Crypto.PublicKey.html">PublicKey</a> used to sign transactions construct
an <em>account</em>.  Since a pair of keys for an account is <em>chosen</em> at offline,
the process so-called &quot;account creation&quot; can be omitted.</p>
<p>An account can also be identified through the <a class="xref" href="../api/Libplanet.Address.html">Address</a> which is
derived from the corresponding <a class="xref" href="../api/Libplanet.Crypto.PublicKey.html">PublicKey</a>.  It is shorter
than <a class="xref" href="../api/Libplanet.Crypto.PublicKey.html">PublicKey</a> and follows the same form to Ethereum's.
This means key pairs that have used for Ethereum can be reused for
Libplanet-backed games too.  For example, a game can raise a fund or receive
donations through Ethereum from crowds and then give them benefits in
the game when they make the first release.</p>
<h2 id="actions-and-states">Actions and states</h2>
<p>Every account starts with an empty state.  Every action in all transactions
an account signed and any actions related to the account determine the current
state of the account.  That is, no state is stored in the blockchain, but only
actions that calculate the next state from the previous state are.</p>
<p>However, on a game engineer's view, Libplanet probably looks like its blockchain
has states as well, because it has the surface to query the current state by
calculating all actions from the start to the end under the hood.  It is also
likely that Libplanet's internals to calculate states will be further optimized
at storage and network levels soon, game engineers are better to use Libplanet's
states API rather than implementing a similar function.</p>
<p>Since all state changes need to be represented through actions, every object
stored in states should be immutable.  Although the storage API accepts
mutable objects too, to colleagues in the game team, it is not apparent to
every state change needs to be represented action if objects are mutable,
hence bug-prone.</p>
<p>As a state is sometimes cached in the storage or transmitted over the network,
it needs to be serializable.  That is, every game object to represent states
must be marked with the <a class="xref" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.serializableattribute">SerializableAttribute</a>.</p>
