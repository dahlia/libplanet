# Since Azure Pipelines does not support YAML anchors as of May 2019,
# we use job and step templates, Azure Pipelines' mini language, instead here.
# It is a domain specific language built upon YAML, and has quite complex
# things.  Read the docs first:
#   https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/process/templates
# Template files are placed in the .azure-pipelines/ directory.
